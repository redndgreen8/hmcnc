### Advanced Usage Examples

**1. Basic Calling from BAM:**
```bash
hmcnclip human_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fasta -a HG002.GRCh38.bam -t 20 -o out.vcf
```

**2. Composite Block Merging & BED Output:**
By default, the HMM outputs contiguous CNV states at bin-level resolution. To merge them into structured composite blocks—bridging over short noisy gaps of diploid (CN=2) states—use the `-M` and `--merge-bridge` flags.
```bash
hmcnclip hg38.fa -a sample.bam -M --merge-bridge 200 --bed composite_calls.bed
```
This produces `composite_calls.bed` with advanced metrics like `domCN` (majority copy number state), `lwCN` (length-weighted copy number), and `peakCN` (maximum absolute CN state).

**3. Single-Chromosome Testing with Custom WG Stats & Exclusion Mask:**
If you want to run the HMM on a single chromosome (e.g. `chr22`) without re-estimating global stats, you can extract stats first using `--stats-only`, and pass them as overrides. You can also exclude pericentromeric regions using `--exclude-regions`.
```bash
# Step 1: Get stats only (optional, can also be computed genome-wide first)
hmcnclip hg38.fa -a sample.bam --stats-only

# Step 2: Run only on chr22, overriding the parameters manually
hmcnclip hg38.chr22.fa -a HG002.chr22.bam \
  -C chr22 \
  --wg-mean 35.2 --wg-var 80.1 --wg-clip-mean 3.4 --wg-clip-var 12.0 \
  --exclude-regions hg38.region_to_EXCLUDE.bed \
  --bed out.bed -o out.vcf
```

**4. Tuning the Emission Penalty:**
To strictly suppress short, spurious CNV calls in noisy genomic regions, you can penalize the emission likelihoods of non-diploid states using the `--epsi-weight` parameter.
```bash
hmcnclip hg38.fa -a sample.bam --epsi-weight 1.5 -o strict_calls.vcf
```

### Key Features Explained

#### 1. Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) Emission Models
Traditional Poisson coverage models fail on long-read datasets because read-depth variance (overdispersion) typically exceeds the mean. `hmcnc` models read-depth and clipping signatures using Negative Binomial distributions and resolves excess zero-observations (zero-inflation) dynamically via Newton-Raphson updates during Baum-Welch M-steps.

#### 2. Directional Clipping Signatures
Modern long-read aligners (like `minimap2` and `pbmm2`) emit supplementary alignments at structural variant breakpoints rather than primary soft-clips. `hmcnc` separates these breakpoints into **leading (left)** and **trailing (right)** signals.
* Left-clips (CN-increasing transitions: $j > i$)
* Right-clips (CN-decreasing transitions: $j < i$)
This creates an asymmetrical transition penalty matrix, preventing the HMM from crossing breakpoints without the physically correct clipping evidence.

#### 3. Composite Block Merging
Raw bin-level HMM outputs often fragment large CNVs due to localized mapping dropouts (appearing as short `CN=2` segments). The built-in `--merge-bridge` algorithm bridges these spurious gaps and emits continuous composite events annotated with robust severity metrics.

#### 4. Exclusion Filtering (`--exclude-regions`)
Pericentromeric arrays and telomeric repeats severely skew global read depth means and inflate variance. By supplying a BED file of exclusion regions, `hmcnc` bypasses these regions during initial parameter estimation *and* during VCF output, producing a highly stable, noise-resistant training baseline.
